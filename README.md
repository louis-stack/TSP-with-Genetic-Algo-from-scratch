# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Solve Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic algorithm


Main idea of Genetic algorithm : 

START
Generate the initial population (1)
Compute fitness (2)
REPEAT (3)
    Selection (3.1)
    Crossover (3.2)
    Mutation (3.3)
    Compute fitness (3.4)
UNTIL population has converged
STOP

Variables to set before : 
- popSize (base 100) 
- mutationRate (base 0.01)
- number of generations (base 1000)
